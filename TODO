How to run the Go tests:

- Update .bazelrc and make sure it points to your `$HOME`
- bazel test //sdk/... should work, but might have test failures in the first run, will succeed afterwards
- Set PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN in the environment

# TODO:

- Make sure integration tests are using the binary bazel is building
- Fix python tests needing `make build_package` being run in sdk/python before anything works
- Improve hacks around yarn install
- Fix setting $HOME and make sure that's overridden to the users home directory
- Figure out why having a `go.work` file at the root doesn't work (it breaks at least //sdk/go/auto:auto_test and //pkg/codegen/go:go_test)
- See if we really need to switch to npm install for conformance tests.  The `mockpackage` linking doesn't currently seem to work with `yarn install`.
