- Make sure integration tests are using the binary bazel is building
- Fix python tests needing `make build_package` being run in sdk/python before anything works
- Improve hacks around yarn install
- Fix setting $HOME and make sure that's overridden to the users home directory
- Figure out why having a `go.work` file at the root doesn't work (it breaks at least //sdk/go/auto:auto_test and //pkg/codegen/go:go_test)
